## Features
This Plugin enables you to "verify" users on your Wordpress Website.

It adds a Checkmark next to the users name, just like on platforms like Twitter or Instagram.

The checkmark is supplied to users belonging to a role you choose.

## Usage
After installing the Plugin you'll get a "Verified Checkmark" Page under "Settings" in your Wordpress admin dashboard. In there you can choose the role that should receive the checkmark.

## More info
### Why isn't this plugin on Wordpress.org?
Well, honestly, I am just too lazy to do it. Maybe it'll be on there some time.
